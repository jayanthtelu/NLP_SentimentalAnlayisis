    "To obtain data related to the University of Maryland, College Park, a data extraction process was performed using the tweepy package, which is a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. The extraction was performed by searching for various hashtags related to the University of Maryland, College Park on Twitter. These hashtags were used as search terms to filter the tweets related to the University of Maryland, College Park. The extracted data was then stored in a data structure for further analysis and processing. This process allowed us to collect relevant data related to the University of Maryland, College Park from Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code utilizes the Twitter API and the Tweepy library to collect tweets related to a set of predefined hashtags. The hashtags are stored in a list and the code loops through each hashtag to search for related tweets. The search is limited to English language tweets and only 100 tweets are returned per page with a maximum of 200 pages per hashtag. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code also filters out retweets and duplicates by keeping track of unique tweets using a set data structure. Regular expressions are used to remove hashtags and URLs from the tweets to clean up the text data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The collected tweets are stored in a Pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file. The DataFrame includes the tweet content, the hashtag it was collected from, and the timestamp of the tweet. The code stops collecting tweets after 3000 unique tweets have been collected across all hashtags. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code provides a useful tool for collecting and analyzing tweets related to specific topics or keywords on Twitter. It could be adapted for various research projects and social media monitoring purposes."

    "This code trains a deep learning model to classify tweets as positive or negative based on their content. The code first reads in preprocessed tweet data and converts the labels to binary values. Then, it tokenizes the text using white space tokenization and pads the sequences of the text. The data is split into training and testing sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model architecture consists of an embedding layer, a convolutional layer, a max pooling layer, a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, a reshape layer, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer, and a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function. The model is compiled using binary cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer. The model is trained on the training data with 25 epochs and a batch size of 128. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code evaluates the model on the test data and calculates the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It also outputs a classification report and a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is displayed using seaborn heatmap."
